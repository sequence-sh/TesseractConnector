# Sequence Tesseract OCR Connector

[SequenceÂ®](https://sequence.sh) is a collection of libraries for
automation of cross-application e-discovery and forensic workflows.

This connector contains steps to perform optical character recognition (OCR)
on image files. It uses the [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
open source library as the OCR engine.
